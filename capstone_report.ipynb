    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Lendingclub.com is one of the leading online p2p lending platforms, where lenders are matched directly to borrowers. Since its inception in 2007, the total amount of loan reaches almost 8 billion US dollars. There are two ways to invest on lendingclub.com: automatic investing and manual investing. In automatic investing, investors specify the amount of risk they are willing to take, and lendingclub automatically invest their money in a mixed portfolio constructed using their algorithms given the risk. For manual investing, investors can browse the notes and the borrowers' information, and select which notes and how much amount they would like to invest. Furthermore, investors don't necessarily have to browser all the notes, instead they can download those data, use their own algorithm to identify which borrowers to lend their money and process them in a batch fashion. Lendingclub provides historical loan information so that one can build machine learning algorithms to predict loan performances. This project aims at identifying loans that may default so that borrowers can avoid those loans using manual investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many similar efforts at predicting defaults using lendingclub data [1-7]. Although the goal of predicting default is the same, there are differences in feature selection, learning algorithms employed and metrics used for evaluating the model performance. In particular, some of the high performing models (for example, Ref [1-2]) incorrectly used fico scores that were produced after a loan is default, thus the results are highly misleading. Other analysis [3-7] select few features and ignore most of features available in the lendingclub dataset. The most comprehensive feature engineering effort comes from Ref. [8], however, they use a different dataset and their goal is to report whether a loan defaults and how much is the loss if a loan defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project, I propose to predict whether a borrower will default so that investors can avoid those borrowers using manual investing feature provided by lendingclub. This, however, does not necessarily lead to highest return on investment (ROI) because by completely avoiding potential defaults, one also avoid riskier loans that may lead to higher ROI even though they default at some point in the future. In order to maximize ROI, one needs to optimize ROI instead. In this project, we work on the simpler problem, that is to predict loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is a binary classification problem: a borrower either default at some time during the loan term or finish payment. In reality, the majority of lendingclub loans are between default and full payment, that is, these loans are on-going. Since investors can only invest in lendingclub notes at initial stage, which means investor can not jump into on-going loans, those on-going loans are irrelevant to our discussion. A binary classification problem is a classic machine learning problem with multiple machine learning algorithms to choose from, has quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, f1 score, etc. to measure the results, and is replicable with the same data and machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "The machine learning task here is an imbalanced two-classed classification, with loan default represents around 20% of all data. Typically f1-score is used for imbalanced classification, however I found that there are two very different f1-scores, depends on which class one is predicting. Instead here I choose area under curve (AUC) as metrics to evaluate learning performance. According to Ref. [9], AUC is a common evaluation metric for binary classification problems. Consider a plot of the true positive rate vs the false positive rate as the threshold value for classifying an item as 0 or is increased from 0 to 1: if the classifier is very good, the true positive rate will increase quickly and the area under the curve will be close to 1. If the classifier is no better than random guessing, the true positive rate will increase linearly with the false positive rate and the area under the curve will be around 0.5. One characteristic of the AUC is that it is independent of the fraction of the test population which is class 0 or class 1: this makes the AUC useful for evaluating the performance of classifiers on unbalanced data sets."

    "#### Basic information\n",
    "According to the above analysis, there are 1,218,316 rows and 115 columns in the loan dataset, with one loan example  shown in the cell above. The 115 columns include information such as borrowers' credit history (such as fico score), personal information (such as annual income, years of employment, zipcode, etc.), loan information (description, type, interest rate, grade, etc.), current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest credit and payment information. You can find the dictionary for the definitions of all data attributes [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx). Since there are too many columns, I will selectly explain a few most important columns/features in the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features \n",
    "Among those columns, I will use loan information, credit history, personal information as features, and discard columns related to latest credit and payment information. Features include but not limited to (partly shown for simplicity): \n",
    " - `funded_amnt`: funded amount \n",
    " - `term`: term of the loan (36 or 60 months)\n",
    " - `grade`: grade of the loan (A to G)\n",
    " - `int_rate`: interest rate\n",
    " - `emp_length`: employment length\n",
    " - `home_ownership`: own, mortgage, rent, or other\n",
    " - `annual_inc`: annual income\n",
    " - `dti`: debt to income ratio\n",
    " - `delinq_2yrs`: delinquency within last 2 years\n",
    " - `fico_range_low`: fico score, lower one\n",
    " - `fico_range_high`: fico score, higher one\n",
    " - `inq_last_6mths`: inquiry within last 6 months\n",
    " - `purpose`: purpose of the loan\n",
    " \n",
    "These and related features have been widely used for default prediction [1-8]. There are three types of data in the dataset: numerical, categorical and text. I plan to use all types. Some numerical variables will be converted to categorical ones, and vice versa; text will be treated using bag-of-words representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that shall not be used\n",
    "In some of the previous work [1, 2], latest credit information such as `last_fico_range_low` and `last_fico_range_high` were used for prediction and lead to high model performance. However, these features are pulled recently according to the date specified in the `last_credit_pull_d` column. Thus the scores were obtained after a loan was fully paid or default, and their high predictive power is a false illusion because low fico score is the consequence of default but is not a predictor for default. As a result, I will exclude them from features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that have lots of NULL values\n",
    "In the following I show the percentage of NULL values for each column that has over 10% NULL data. The percentage data here is only for illustration only, because the actual number will change after data preprocessing detailed in Data Preprocessing section."

The second type is truly missing information, for example, `desc` (description provided by borrowers), `open_acc_6m` and all other columns that has 71.0935% missing data (these are columns that were only recently populated thus missing in previous years). The third type is a mix of the first two types, for example, `mths_since_last_major_derog` is meaningful, yet carefully exam the data shows that the first 10% of loan data is missing.

Further exam of the data (didn't show here) indicates that loans with fico score between 600 and 650 are the one with `loan_status` \"Does not meet the credit policy\" but nevertheless issued.

The reason for the high loan default rate around 2008 is due to financial crisis. The reason for high loan default rate after 2014 is: a typical loan lasts 3 to 5 years, for loans initiated after 2014 most of people are still paying (thus removed from the dataset) and people who already default is included in the dataset and over-represents the population.

    "### Algorithms and Techniques\n",
    "The loan dataset is a time-series dataset with over 400,000 rows and imbalanced data (20% of data belongs to one class), has both numeric and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification algorithms\n",
    "There are many machine learning algorithms to perform classification. Since the current dataset is relatively large with over 400,000 rows, algorithms such as Support Vector Machine and K-nearest Neighbor will take too long to train and won't be used here. Here I intend to use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods (Random Forest), all available in sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering. [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I intend to use Gaussian Naive Bayes classification method implemented in scikit-learn. Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes the likelihood of the features to be Gaussian. There's only one parameter for the algorithm: the class prior. The default value for class prior is the probably of each class, which is a reasonable assumption here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a method to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more independent variables. Logistic function can be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "<center> $\\displaystyle F(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x}}}$ </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ are independent variables, and $F(x)$ is the probability of the dependent variable to be predicted. As one can see from the above logistic function, only linear relationship between the independent variables are taken into account, thus the model can't capture any non-linear relationship between features. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problem with logistic regression is that coefficients $\\beta_i$ are unbound and can take extreme values, making other features useless and model unstable. There are several ways to introduce regularization. Here I use the logistic regression method implemented in scikit-learn, in which $C$ and `penalty` are the regularization parameters. $C$ is a numeric continuous value inserted into logistic function and the default value is 1. `penalty` takes two choices: L1 and L2 regularization with the default value being L2 regularization. L1 regularization is very useful if one needs to reduce dimensions of features since it tends to produce more zero coefficients. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the class is not balanced in the lendingclub dataset, I also plan to tune the `class_weight` parameter available in the logistic regression method in scikit-learn. The default value is None; one can also choose 'balanced' or define their own class_weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Random Forest\n",
    "Ensemble Methods combine the results of many base models (weak learners), can handle categorical variables and outliers very well, and can handle non-linear relationship between features. Although its relatively slower to train compared to Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, the training time is still reasonable given the current dataset size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project I chose Random Forest, which combines the results of many decision trees. Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html]. Decision trees tend to overfit the data. In the extreme case of a decision tree having one leaf for every data point, the training precision will be 100%, but the result won't be able to generalize. Random forest combines multiple such decision trees and optimize the combined model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, the major problem for decision trees and random forest is overfitting. There are several parameters to tune in random forest implementation in scikit-learn: `n_estimators` (number of trees to grow), `min_samples_split` (minimum number of data points to split a tree), `min_samples_leaf` (minimum number of data points for leaf). In addition, I also plan to tune `max_features` (maximum number of features to use to split tree), `bootstrap` (whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees). The reason for bootstrap is because the data is imbalanced and one can use bootstrap to enhance the representation of the class with less data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Under or over-sampling for imbalanced data\n",
    "The loan dataset is imbalanced with 20% representing one class. I intend to use under or over-sampling techniques, implemented in the `imbalanced-learn` package [http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/index.html] and compare the modeling result with the one without sampling. In both under and over-sampling technique, the returned data has balanced class label of 50% for each binary class. \n",

    "According to the above results, the changes in scores are very small or even zero for perturbations applied to all features, indicating that the model is stable enough for predictions.\n",

    "### Justification\n",
    "There are two set of benchmarks established earlier in the project. The first one is random guessing with auc score of 0.5 and the second set includes previous results using lendingclub data: \n",
    "- Ref [3]: AUC 0.698\n",
    "- Ref [5]: AUC 0.732\n",
    "- Ref [6]: AUC 0.713\n",
    "\n",
    "The result here with auc score 0.707 is much better than random guessing, and similar to previous results. Ref. [5] and [6] give slightly better score. In fact, the best score in Ref. [5] came from a logistic regression model and was better than optimized random forest model. One of the reason contributes to the difference may be that Ref. [5] and [6] used different cross-validation split methods than the forward chaining cross-validation used in this study.  \n",

    "### Free-Form Visualization \n",
    "Here I visualize the ROC curve for the final model. The x-axis for the ROC curve is FP (False Positive) rate and the y-axis is TP (True positive) rate. The plot shows that the model prediction is better han random guess, which is the diagonal line running from (0, 0) to (1, 1). The different lines in the plot correspond to the different folds in the cross-validation process."

    "#### Summary of the entire end-to-end problem solution\n",
    "The workflow for this problem is: \n",
    "1. Data cleaning and pre-processing\n",
    "    - handle missing values and columns that have systematic missing values;\n",
    "    - convert categorical variables into numerical variables depends on whether the categorical variables are nominal or not. If they are nominal, use ordered number; and if they are not, use dummy variables; \n",
    "    - convert other relevant variables to numerical ones, for example, convert `earliest_cr_line` which is year, to number of years with credit history;\n",
    "    - remove outliers;\n",
    "    - normalize features;\n",
    "2. Train and optimize classifier\n",
    "    - perform rolling cross validation for time series data;\n",
    "    - compare resampling techniques: no resampling, random under sampling and random over sampling\n",
    "    - compare three classification models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Ensemble (Random Forest);\n",
    "    - optimize model parameters and find the best model/parameters;\n",
    "3. Compare results with benchmark models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reflection on the project\n",
    "Initially I thought the project is easy, since there has been quite a few other efforts available online, see Ref[1-8]. Most of these references performed classification to predict whether a loan defaults; except in Ref. [8] where the goal is not only to predict default as a classification task, but also to predict severity of the loss as a regression task. My initial goal is to use lendingclub data, but go beyond those previous efforts and predict return on investment (ROI). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there was no previous work on predicting ROI using lendingclub data, my plan was to first perform a classification task to predict default, compare the results with previous models, and move on to work on how to predict ROI. However, it turned out that the classification problem was more challenging than I thought, there are various problems with previous work (detailed in Project Overview Section), and I found out just completing the loan default prediction is worthwhile as a standalone project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the interesting and challenging aspects of the project: \n",
    "- The dataset has over 115 columns, is diverse and non-trivial for data cleaning and preprocessing. One has to read the description of all 115 columns in order to remove columns thats not supposed to be used. This was a mistake made by a few previous work and their results are incorrect and misleading. There are also various ways data is missing, has outliers, and has different ways to be converted to numeric data. I found the data cleaning and pre-processing more challenging and time consuming than I presumed. \n",
    "- The data is a time-series data, thus random or stratified shuffle spliting for training and testing dataset might not be appropriate; however, none of the previous work mentioned the time-series aspect. \n",
    "- The prediction classes are not balanced, with default loan occupying around 20% of all data. However, under and over sampling have neglectable effect on cv scores. \n",
    "- Logistic regression has similar results compared to random forest. This is rather surprising to me. With Kaggle's loan dataset, ensemble methods are reported to be much better than logistic regression and gives auc score over 0.85. In this blogpost (http://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/capstone/kaggle-predict-consumer-credit-default/), the authors were able to increase the score for logistic regression using features from non-linear combination of original features. However, these non-linear combination of features are inherently present in ensemble methods and thus feature engineering doesn't improve performance for ensemble methods. In the current case with lendingclub data ( Kaggle has a different dataset), ensemble methods are only slightly better than logistic regression. I tried a number of feature selection/ellimination methods, as well as producing non-linear combination of features, but none of my work has resulted in any significant improvements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final model and solution doesn't fit my expectation for the problem, and I expect the model to perform better. In a future project, I might work with Kaggle dataset and find out why Kaggle dataset gives better scores. In addition, as I mentioned in Project Overview, best predicting loan default does not neccessarily give best ROI, since it will reject default loans regardless on how much amount is the loss. As a result, one has to solve a different problem in order to optimize ROI. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "One possible improvement to the final auc score is convert additional columns to features. The columns that are currently not used are `zip_code` and `addr_state`. One can use econometric values such as median income of the zip code or state. Another possible improvement is to use text as a vector for columns `title` and `desc`. There are many missing values there, and in this project I only used boolean values to represent them. However I doubt the effectiveness of them compared to features such as `int_rate` and `annual_inc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further improvement to the project is to predict ROI, since ROI is what eventually matters. "
